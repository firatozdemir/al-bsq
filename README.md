#### Active Learning for Segmentation Based on Bayesian Sample Querying 

A representativeness metric proposed for the acquisition function of an active learning framework. 
The code here implements the representativeness aspect of the two stage (uncertainty + representativeness) acqusition function proposed by [Ozdemir et. al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2020.106531).  
Please feel free to report any issues/bugs.
